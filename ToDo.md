# To Do

## Features

### Better error messages when raising exceptions?

 
## Issues

### Turning off VT100mode prints a board on _every_ update. The resulting boards scrolling in the console makes it look like there are a few board being displayed, all updating simultaneously. It would nice to figure a way to make it more obvious what's really happening. 

### When message line count changes it can overlap cursor & existing stdout.

### Hide cursor?
